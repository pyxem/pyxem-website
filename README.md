# The Pyxem Website Repo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pyxem/pyxem-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pyxem/pyxem-website)

This is the place to edit the website of the pyxem organization. The website can be seen its glory by pointing a browser at https://pyxem.github.io/pyxem-website/



### Some hints for contributors

* Pages are made from files (.rst) in the doc folder and should be edited in the "normal" way. These are then compiled (by Travis, see .travis.yml) and shortly aftwards the website updates. The final .html files can be found on the gh-pages branch. 

* The website is built once a day by Travis so not all merged changes will appear immediately.
