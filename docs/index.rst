pyxem - Crystallographic Electron Microscopy in Python
======================================================


pyxem is an organisation that develops open-source Python libraries for electron microscopy.
The packages were originally developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-imaging
microscopy based on scanning electron diffraction (SED) data, but they now do a wide range of things! However, the largest package remains the eponyomous one: pyxem - which is focussed on scanning diffraction.

orix - for quaternion, rotation, and orientation handling in Python. `Github <http://pyxem.github.io/pyxem/orix>`__

kikuchipy - for processing and analysing EBSD data. `Webpage <https://kikuchipy.org>`__

other important packages
------------------------
These packages are central to the scientific functionality of pyxem:

- `HyperSpy <http://hyperspy.org>`__ for multi-dimensional data handling.

- `DiffPy <http://diffpy.org>`__ - for atomic structure manipulation.


.. warning::

    All parts of the pyxem project are under continual development and there may be bugs. As such please use all methods with care.
